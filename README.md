# my-favicons

Hand-coded SVG favicons that comply with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and mostly comply with [Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.1 (Second Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/) (see note below).  Each subdirectory is dedicated to one favicon with a README and any derivitives.

NOTE: SVG 1.1 does not support [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) attributes on SVG elements.  However, the [SVG 2 draft](https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/) does.  They also work in modern browsers, as does the SVG 2 specification of [Conforming SVG Stand-Alone Files](https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/conform.html#ConformingSVGStandAloneFiles).  In these two ways these SVG favicons do not completely validate against the SVG 1.1 W3C recommendation.

## What the project does

This repository contains favicons that I have created using hand-crafted SVG, the way SVG was intended to be used, sometimes derivitives in other graphics formats, and a README describing what each file is and what it is for.

## Why the project is useful

Although the various favicon designs are probably not widely applicable to others, the techniques I applied in creating them may be useful to others.  Certainly the proper use of favicons will improve the performance and user friendliness of any website or webapp.

## How users can get started with the project

Improve yourself.  Borrow the code.  Read the commented SVG code.  Understand the code.  Improve it where you can and submit a Pull Request, so I can improve *myself*.

## Where users can get help with your project

This repository contains one subdirectory per favicon.  Each one should contain a README specific to that particular favicon.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project

So far this has been an individual and personal effort.  If you have ideas on how to make this more benficial to a broader audience, please contact me.
